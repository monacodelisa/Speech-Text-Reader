<h2>Text to speech app for non-verbal people.</h2> <p>Pre-made button options and custom text to speech. <br> This project uses the Web Speech API</p>

<p>And it's part of the <strong>'20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript'</strong><br>
course by Brad Traversy on Udemy, which I did around - May 15, 2022.<br>
It is project 13: Speech Text Reader | Speech Synthesis</p>

<h2>I extended the functionality and made it Multi-lingual</h2>

<p>The original version of the project only supports English.<br> I added two additional languages - <strong>Hebrew</strong> and <strong>Bulgarian</strong></p>

<p>Contribution for the flag icons:<br>
